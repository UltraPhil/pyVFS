pyVFS
=====

What is pyVFS?
--------------
I'm trying to make a pythonic module to mount all kind of format as virtual filesystem mountpoints internally in a application.
It's my first attempt to make an OpenSource project.

What I'm planning to support:
- localy:
	- raw file
	- "big" files
	- compressed files:
		- zip
		- tar
		- gzip
		- etc
	- raw partitions
	- basic partitions like fat32
	- ZFS vdevs?

- externally:
	- FTP
	- HTTP
		- Web servers "default content listing" pages
	- Webdav
	- Others:
		- Google Docs
		- Googel mail?
		- CloudApp?
		- DropBox?

Other features?
---------------
I thought of maybe adding a "Monitor" class.
That class would be responsible to monitor changes to a file system, either at specified intervals, or constantly.
That'll be to determine in a near future.
